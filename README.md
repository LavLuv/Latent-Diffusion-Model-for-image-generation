# Latent Diffusion Model for image generation

Using a moderate-sized dataset of cat images, training a Latent Diffusion Model to generate new cat images  

Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), an efficient version of Diffusion Models, can be trained on and used to generate various categories and types of images. They can also be quite effectively used for various Computer Vision tasks like Image Super-Resolution, Image Enhancement, Image Restoration, Image Inpainting, Image style transfer, etc. and hence have multiple applications in many real-life domains
